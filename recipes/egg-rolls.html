    <h3> Description</h3>
    <p>Egg rolls consist of thick, crispy wheat flour skin filled <br>with shredded cabbage, pork, and other ingredients. <br>Eggs rolls are then fried in hot oil, served warm, and <br>then usually dipped in soy sauce.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
       <li>1 pound ground pork</li> 
       <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
       <li>2 cups of shredded cabbage</li>
       <li>2 ounces shredded carrots</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons of all purpose flour</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons of water</li>
       <li>1 quart peanut oil or vegetable oil</li>
       <li>8 egg roll wrappers</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season pork with ginger and garlic powder in a large bowl; mix until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <br><li>Place pork in a medium skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir until pork is browned and crumbly</li>
        <br><li>Combine cooked pork, cabbage, and carrots in a large bowl; mix until egg roll filling is well combined.</li>
        <br><li>Mix flour and water together in a small bowl until a paste forms.</li>
        <br><li>Heat oil in a large skillet to about 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) or medium high heat.</li>
        <br><li>While oil is heating, prepare egg rolls: Lay one egg roll wrapper on a flat surface with one corner pointed toward you like a diamond. Place 1/4 to 1/3 cup of the filling in the center of the wrapper. Fold the bottom corner up and over the filliling. Fold the left and right corners in toward the center. Push the egg roll away from you and roll toward the top corner. Brush a bot of the flour paste over the inside of that corner to help seal the egg roll.</li>
