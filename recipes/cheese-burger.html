    <h3 class="header">Description</h3>
    <p class="description"> A cheese burger is a hamburger topped with cheese.<br>Traditionally, the slice of cheese is placed on top of <br> the meat patty. The cheese is usually added to the <br> cooking hamburger patty shortly before serving, <br> which allows the cheese to melt. Cheeseburgers <br> can include variations in structure, ingredients <br> and composition.</p>
    <h3 class="header">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredient">
        <li>1 1/2 pounds 80% lean ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>8 thin slices of cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>4 soft sesame buns</li>
        <li>bibb lettuce and sliced tomato</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="header">Directions</h3>
    <ol class="font-change">
        <li>Sprinkle the ground beef evenly with 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Gently form the meat into 4 balls, then lightly press into 4-inch-wide, 1-inch-thick patties. Make a 2-inch-wide indentation in the center of each with your thumb to prevent the burgers from bulging when grilled.</li>
        <br><li>Preheat a grill to high. Season the patties with salt and pepper. Grill, undisturbed, until marked on the bottom, 3 to 5 minutes. Turn and grill until the other side is marked and the patties feel firm, 3 to 5 more minutes; if desired, top each burger with 2 slices cheese during the last 2 minutes of cooking and cover with a disposable aluminum pan to melt.</li>
        <br><li>Serve the patties on the buns; top with lettuce and tomato.</li>
