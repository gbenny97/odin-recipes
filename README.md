# odin-recipes
Website that will have unordered list of food I like with links on each item in the list
Link will take you to the recipe for each food you click on with a list of the ingredients needed
Next is an ordered list for prepping the food along with pictures of the said food 
I should be able to demonstrate basic knowledge of html being able to use different elements to form and index page and links to other web pages for each food I choose.
